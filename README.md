# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript + Calcite + Lit Example

This project was started from the LitElement TypeScript starter - see the readme for that [here](https://github.com/lit/lit-element-starter-ts/blob/6abfcfa55e01bbe4e2633dc3024bf7a3469db1b3/README.md).

## Quick Start

Clone the repo, then in a terminal:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run serve
```
